# Deque

A Deque is a special array/list based data structure that allows for O(1) prepend and O(1) append. This is usually known as a double-ended queue, allowing for O(1) operations on pop() and dequeue() operations.


You have two ways to implement this:

* LinkedList based solution

* Array based solution (Which has the benefit of allowing for O(1) get operations).


Make sure you implement the following:

* `pop()` - Removes from the end of the list

* `append()` - Adds to the end of the list

* `prepend()` - Adds to the front of the list

* `dequeue()` - Removes from the front of the list


## How to test

You can test your solution using `npm run test`, make sure you install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
